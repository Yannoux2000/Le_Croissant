# Le Croissant (Par of the Boulangerie Bot Family)

_Thoses names used for thoses two bots, Le Baguette and Le Croissant, are used in a non-serious, non-xenophobic intent, but simply as a silly joke. Anyone being offended by the uses of theses words in this, or any context, should relax and by a Chocolatine._
